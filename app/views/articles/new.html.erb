<%# the form_with specific abstraction submits its data via AJAX, we can override
that to get the standard form submit behavior (using local: true flag) - page reload, 
response is an HTML page instead of JSON, and etc %>
<%#  need to give it the model that the form will be working with as a symbol %>
<%# articles_path is an abstraction of the path to the articles %>
<%# using the form builders packaged by RAILS means we also get an "authenticity token" 
field auto generated. This protects the app from recieving form submits from sources
that is not the official view generated by the app
